# World Happiness Report 2023 Analysis
In this project, I delve into the annual report, shedding light on the world's happiest nations and discover the key factors influencing global happiness and well-being.

# Trust in the Social Contract and Life Satisfaction ü§ù
Ever wondered about the link between **citizens' trust in their government** and a country's **happiness**? 
I have. In this analysis, I focus on the correlation between a critical metric, trust in government fairness and freedom from corruption, and a nation's happiness ranking. Uncover the insights that shape the happiness landscape and explore how trust impacts the overall well-being of societies.

While happiness and life satisfaction can appear intangible, subjective, and difficult to measure and quantify, I have created a collection of visual explorations that breathe life into World Happiness Report metrics.
Explore the insights and spark conversation about how we might begin to approach the quest for a happier, not to mention, better-informed world.
